#### Chapter One: Strategies for Problem Solving.

* Problems include constraints - unbreakable rules about the problem or the way in which the problem must be solved. 
* When solving a problem with a program, you also have constraints. Common constraints - programming language, platform, performance, or memory footprint.
* In programming, we can define problem solvign as writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constrants of that definition. 
* In problem solving, look to recognize the analogy - an exploitable similarity between a solved problem and an unsolved problem. That is to say, if we recognize that a feature of problem A is analogous to a feature of problem B and we have already solved problem B, we have valuable insight into solving problem A.
  
Example Problem 1: How to cross the river?  
A farmer with a fox, a goose, and a sack of corn need to cross a river. The farmer has a rowboat, but there is room for only the farmer and one of his three items. Unfortuntely, both the fox and the goose are hungry. THe fox cannot be left alone with the goose, or the fox will eat the goose. Likewise, the goose cannot be left alone with the sack of corn, or the goose will eath the corn.
How does the farmer get everything across the river.

Solution:
Take the goose - Take the fox - Bring back the goose - Take the corn - Take the goose  

Takeaway: If you are unaware of all possible actions you coudl take, you may be unable to solve the problem. By enumerating all the possible operations, we can solve many problems by testing every combination of oerpations until we find one that works. More generally, by restating a problem in more formal terms, we can often uncover solutions that would have otherwise eluded us.  
In some cases, thinking about the problem may be as productive (or more productve) than thinking about the solution.  
  
  
Example Problem 2: The Sliding Eight    
A 3x3 grid is filled with eight tiles, numbered 1 through 8, and one empty space. Initially, the grid is in a jumbled configuration. A tile can be slid into an adjacent empty space, leaving the tile's preivous location empty. THe goal is to slide the tiles to place the grid in an ordered configuration, from tile 1 in the upper left.  
  
By breaking the problem down into a 2x3, we can see that we can use certain techniques to solve the smaller puzzle. One such technique is called "the train" - where you get the numbers in order but out of place and then you push the into place like a train on tracks.  
  
Takeaway: In problem solving, we are somtimes faced with situtaions where we can't see a clear path to code teh solution, but we must never allow this to be an excuse to forgo planning and systematic approach. It's better to develop a strategy than to attack the problem through trial and error.  
Additionally, looking for a way to divide a problem is usually time well spent. Even if you are unable to find a clean division, you may learn something about th eproblem that helps you solve it.   
When solving problems, workign with a specific goal in mind is always better than random effort, whether you acheive that speicfic goal or not.  
  
  
Example Problem 3: Completing the Sudoku Square  
A 9x9 grid is partially filled with single digis (from 1-9) and the player must fill in the empty squares while meetign certain constrains. In each row and column, each digit must appear exactly once. In each marked 3x3 area, each digit must appear exactly once.

Solution:
The row and column constraints dictate which numbers could go where. So, start with squares with the lowest number of possible values.  
  
Takeaway: Start with the parts with the most constraints, they may allow you to simplify our thinking about the solution, because they eliminate choices.  
Additionally, start with the part that's obvious. If you can solve part of the problem, go ahead and do what you can. You might learn something in that process that will help you solve the rest.  
  
Example Problem 4: Opening the Alien Lock  
Note: This problem statement is long. I won't be writing it. To re-read it is on page 13   

Solution:  
This long problem is just the fox, goose, corn problem in disguise.    
Takeaway: Look for analogies.

* Always have a plan
* Restate the problem
* Divide the problem
* Start with what you know
* Reduce the problem
* Look for analogies
* Experiement
* Don't get frustrated
