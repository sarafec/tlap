#### Chapter 1 - Exercise 1-2
Problem: Consider a sliding tile puzzle variant where the tiles are covered with a picture instead of numbers. How much does this increase the difficulty, and why?

  
Solution: Having to view the picture as a "train" will always be harder than viewing numbers as a "train." You'd have to slice up the photo in your head and keep track of which slice belongs where.
