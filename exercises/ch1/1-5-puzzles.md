#### Chapter 1 - Exercise 1-5
Problem: Try to write some explicit strategies for traditional "pencil and paper" games, like crosswords. Where should you start? What should you do when stuck? What is your strategy? 
  
Solution: I'll list some strategies I can think of - 
* Do the obvious first. Whether it is a crosswords or word jumble, seek out what seems clear before moving onto the more difficult.
* When stuck ask a friend or your pal google. I don't see the appeal to crossword puzzles sometimes because if I don't know something, but I would like to learn about it it is a couple keystrokes away. 
* When stuck and google can't help you, lean on analogies from other problems. Is that riddle actually an algrebra problem in disguise? Have you seen a question like this before in other circumstances?
