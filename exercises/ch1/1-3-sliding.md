#### Chapter 1 - Exercise 1-3
Problem: Find a strategy for sliding tile puzzles different from the book's.

  
Solution: Depending on the size of the tile puzzle, you could split up the board into groups of four (or some other multiple). Sort of a divide and conquer strategy, where you're focused on getting those groups set up and then manuevering the groups around the puzzle. This strategy might work better for certain puzzles (4x4) and less well or not at all for others (2x34).
