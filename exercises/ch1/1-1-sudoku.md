#### Chapter 1 - Exercise 1-1
Problem: Try a medium-difficulty sudoku puzzle, experiementing with different strategies and taking note of the results. Can you write a general plan for solving a sudoku?

  

Solution: I generally solve sudoku puzzles by finding the 3x3 areas with the most numbers and figuring out what possible numbers could be in there. Then finding the 1x9 rows that have the most numbers and figuring out what possible numbers could be in there. Then cross checking those areas for conflicts (i.e. the 2 can only go in one of the two places on a 1x9, but a 3 could go in either). Rinse, repeat.
