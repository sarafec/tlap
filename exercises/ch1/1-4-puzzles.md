#### Chapter 1 - Exercise 1-4
Problem: Search for old-fashioned puzzles and try to solve them (look for Sam Loyd). Find the solution. How would you make an easier version of the puzzle? What would you have to change? The constraints themselves or just the wording?
  
Solution: The puzzle I chose was the 'Great Picnic Puzzle.' In this puzzle, every wagon in town goes to the great annual picnic. Each wagon carries the same number of people. On the way to the picnic, 10 wagons broke down so each of the remaining wagons had to carry 1 addditional person. On the way home, 15 wagons broke down and each of the remaining wagons had to carry 3 more people than they started with in the morning. How many people attended the great annual picnic?
  
There were 900 picnic attendees, wp = (w-10)(p+1) = (w-25)(p+3)
There were 9 passengers at the beginning of the day and 100 wagons.

This problems has a tricky set of wording that I didn't catch on first read through. Luckily, I caught it on the second. It says, "each of the remaining wagons had to carry 3 more people than they started with in the morning." That in the morning part if skipped could change the whole problem.  
  
Additional clues to add to the problem could include: how many wagons they started with, how many people per wagon, or changing the tricky wording I mentioned above.
